This project demonstrates the power ML on modeling critically-ill patients outcomes. The notebook contains data exploration, cleaning, and feature engineering.
There were four types of models trained and developed on the data set: a Neural Network (keras + tensorflow), random forest, logistic regression, and XGBoost. All the evaluation
of the models is also in the notebook.

The end result was the random forest was the strongest performer of the four models.
